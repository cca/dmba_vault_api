        "description": "It takes money to make money. Businesses need varying amounts of funds at different stages and for almost every process. In fact, the flow of funds itself is a process that needs money to maintain. In our study we looked at both sides of the coin -- what entrepreneurs/businesses can do to raise money, and what kind of investments might be valuable for investors to explore. \n\nAn investor is a person who allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return. On the flip side, an entrepreneur is an individual who runs a small business and assumes all the risk and reward of a given business venture. An entrepreneur/business looks to the market to raise funds. The market will part with funds only if the risks are offset sufficiently by the potential of the business. Investors leverage their capacity to lend money to satisfy the demand with the intention of collecting returns. While the approach of each varies, the purpose -- making a profit -- doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe looked at a number of traditional routes entrepreneurs take to raise funds, as well as some variants across the globe. We also researched various sectors on the basis of current popularity and future growth prospects. \n\nOur report is useful for: \nEntrepreneurs: to get a very brief overview of some of the venture financing options out there\nInvestors: to describe some of the hottest sectors in the venture investing and startup worlds\n",

The online platform acts as the customer\u2019s first touch point, where they enter information about the type of gift they are looking for, who it is for, and a few key questions to lay the groundwork for our service.  The customer is then contacted by one of our GIFTD experts, via phone call, real-time online chat, or email, whichever is the most convenient.  This is where the GIFTD expert gains unique insights from anecdotes and a personal conversation, to better inform and curate a selection of gifts that truly match what the customer is looking for.  After the efficient and insightful chat, the GIFTD expert gets to work.  Working from a bank of quality products and stores, the insights gained from the customer are used to find great gift ideas.  The personalized service continues, with a brief description of 5 gift ideas, why they would be a good fit, the cost, and where or how to purchase them.  \n\nThe gift giving industry in the US alone is a $298 billion market. Gift cards account for $90 billion of this market.  Capturing only a fraction of a percent of this market amounts to revenues of $28 million. We are projecting our revenue generation on capturing money that consumers are already spending on gifts.   \n",

        "description": "Many people go to the gym to burn calories from the food they have eaten or have stored up as fat. In this burning process, the human body uses most of the energy to keep your body running, but 25% of caloric intake is released in various forms of energy such as kinetic. This includes everything from lifting weights to running on a treadmill or even walking around between workouts. There is potential disruption in the human expenditure loss. In a world where energy is burned for almost everything and \"net-zero\u201d is nowhere close to everyone\u2019s first priority, there is much room for improvement.\n<br><br>\nCurrent technology exists through energy capture cardio machines and energy capture floors, which transmit kinetic energy to energy that can be used to power mobile phones, lighting, entire buildings and stadiums. Smaller niche gyms such as Green MicroGym in Portland, Organ and University Institutions such as UC Berkeley have already implemented these types of ideas into their exercise facilities. Energy capture from fitness is not a new concept, but the system has not been perfected.\n<br><br>\nPulse Gym aims to provide a full-service gym directly in competition with leading gyms like 24 Hour Fitness, LifeTime Fitness and Equinox. Pulse Gym's objectives:\n<br><br>\n- Pulse uses Energy Capture machines and PAVE technology throughout the gym to partially power up the gym and connect wirelessly through web technologies for data analytics and visualization.\n<br><br>\n- Pulse aims to connect people socially and environmentally through \u201cpulse touchpoints\u201d such as the Livable Garden and the Juice Bar. \n<br><br>\n- Pulse employs individuals who are fitness-minded and eco-conscious, but also provides an open-source framework where trainers may rent space to foster a broad and diverse fitness community.\n<br><br>\n- Pulse balances technology, nature and communities by offering different types of fitness activities to provide a total mind-body-earth experience that is enjoyable, educational and meaningful.\n<br><br>\nPulse gym provides at a minimum the same services traditional gyms offer, but what makes our service unique is the vision of a human-powered facility working towards net-postive results for both the individual's body and the health of the environment.",
